# VietSingðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¶

In this repository we present the code for baseline methods that were used to evaluation of VietSing dataset. We used DiffSinger and VISinger2 as our models. In order to reproduce our work with VietSing dataset, please use the code in this repository and follow the instruction in each folder.

Besides, we also provide audio samples taken from the VietSing dataset and its corresponding synthesised singing voice from the models, you can find the samples in ./samples folder.
Currently due to license limitation, we cannot provide the full dataset publicly, to request for the full version of the dataset, please contact Mr. Dat (hdtran@i2r.a-star.edu.sg). Once the license matter is resolved, we will push the link to this repository and make it free to use. We hope our data is helpful for your research!
